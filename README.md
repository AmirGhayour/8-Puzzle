# 8-Puzzle

I developed this game during the Spring semester of 2018 as part of my _Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems: Design of Algorithms_ course.

I implemented the game using Java, and A* algorithm. No GUI. 

The game uses A* algorithm to solve the puzzle.

To run the game, navigate to the bin directory and execute the following command: 
```bash
java Main
```
